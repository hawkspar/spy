Lutz's code in cooled_cylinder.zip.
-cooled cylinder.pdf documentation 
-baseflow.py: calculate the base flow at different Re.
-EVP.py: modal analysis of base flow. For isothermal base flow at Re=47, you should find a temporal growth close to zero.
-timestepper.py: doing timestepping for unstable case. (not useful for you at this moment)
-cylinderModule.py: main class.
-Mesh: (you do not need to change anything at this moment, because every file is already created.) Mesh is generated by gmsh from script .geo to .msh. Then .msh is converted to .xdmf by meshio, or converted to .xml by Fenics function dolfin-convert, so that it can be read by Fenics later.

FELiCS.yml: Thomas's and my environment to install and run Fenics. Use mini-conda to install. (This file is for linux! If you work with Mac, there is another version that Thomas sent me.)
